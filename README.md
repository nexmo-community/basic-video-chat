# Building a Basic Video Chat With Opentok

This is part 1 of a series of tutorials that will explore the [OpenTok API](https://tokbox.com/developer/) and what you can build with it. The OpenTok API is very robust and highly customisable, so we will gradually build up and expand the features of our application, starting off with the most basic audio-video chat.

We will not be using any frontend frameworks for this series, just vanilla Javascript in order to keep the focus on the OpenTok interface itself. At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to start an audio-video chat with a friend by sharing a link with them.
