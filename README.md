# Create a Basic Video Chat with Vonage Video API

This series of tutorials will explore the [Vonage Video API](https://tokbox.com/developer/) (formerly TokBox OpenTok) and what you can build with it. The Video API is very robust and highly customisable, and in each post weâ€™ll show how to implement a specific feature using the API, starting with the most basic audio-video chat.

We will not be using any frontend frameworks for this series, just vanilla Javascript in order to keep the focus on the Vonage Video API itself. At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to start an audio-video chat with a friend by sharing a link with them.
